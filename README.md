# Android Remote AI2

## Description

This repository contains a project for controlling a robot via Bluetooth commands using an Android app and managing related functionality through Platform IO files. The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Android App**: Created with MIT App Inventor 2, this app controls the robot via Bluetooth commands.
2. **Platform IO**: Contains the firmware and configuration files for managing the robot's behavior and Bluetooth communication.

## Modifying the Project

### Android App

#### Customizing Icons
1. Open Icon Generator.pptx and replace icons. Proper order is important because the filename that will be generated in the next step is based on the order provided in the script. Make sure no extra slides in the presentation.
Save the file and close powerpoint.
2. In the Windows File Explorer, click the ```IconBuilder.vbs``` script. This will automatically generate png file icons that will be used in modifying the Android App buttons.

#### Building the App

1. **Import the Project**:
   - Go to [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/), sign in, and import the `.aia` file for the project via **Projects** > **Import project (.aia) from my computer**.

2. **Modify the App**:
   - Change the appâ€™s name by going to **Project** > **Project Properties** and updating the **App Name** field.

3. **Compile the App**:
   - Click on **Build** > **App (provide QR code for .apk)** to compile the app. Scan the QR code with MIT AI2 Companion to test the app on an Android device.

### Platform IO

#### Prerequisite 
1. PlatformIO IDE Extension
   - if not yet installed refer to this [How to setup PlatformIO IDE on VS Code](github.com/wryte4me/how-to-setup-platformio-ide-on-vs-code) guide to install.
2. USB to TTL Drivers 
   - refer to this [How to install Arduino Board drivers](github.com/wryte4me/how-to-install-arduino-board-drivers) guide to ensure that your Arduino boards can be detected by your device.


#### Configuring Firmware

1. **Edit Configuration**:
   - Open `platformio.ini` to configure build settings and dependencies for the firmware.

2. **Modify Source Code**:
   - Navigate to the `src/` directory to modify or add source code files. This is where you can change how the robot responds to Bluetooth commands and manage its behavior.

3. **Upload Firmware**:
   - Use Platform IO to build and upload the firmware to the robot. This can be done through the Platform IO interface in VS Code or by using command-line tools.

- [Platform IO Documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/): Resources for configuring and using Platform IO.

## Troubleshooting

- **Android App Issues**:
  - Ensure that the correct icons are uploaded and that they match the required sizes.
  - Verify Bluetooth commands in the app match those expected by the robot's firmware.

- **Platform IO Issues**:
  - Check `platformio.ini` for correct configuration settings.
  - Review firmware code for compatibility with your hardware.
